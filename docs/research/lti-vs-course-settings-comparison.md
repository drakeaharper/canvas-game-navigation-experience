# LTI vs Course Settings Comparison

## The Key Question: LTI Tool vs Internal Course Setting?

You're absolutely right to question the LTI approach! After examining Canvas's course settings architecture, building as an internal course setting would be significantly simpler and better integrated.

## Course Settings Approach ⭐ **MUCH BETTER**

### How Course Settings Work
Canvas course settings follow a modular pattern where each setting:
1. **Backend**: Stored in `course.settings` hash (serialized JSON)
2. **Frontend**: React components mounted to specific DOM elements
3. **Integration**: Direct access to Canvas models, permissions, and APIs

### Implementation Pattern
```typescript
// Frontend: ui/features/course_settings/index.tsx
const gameSettingsContainer = document.getElementById('game_settings_container')
if (gameSettingsContainer) {
  const gameSettingsRoot = createRoot(gameSettingsContainer)
  gameSettingsRoot.render(
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <ErrorBoundary errorComponent={<ErrorMessage />}>
        <CourseGameSettings 
          canManage={ENV.PERMISSIONS.manage}
          gameEnabled={ENV.COURSE_GAME_ENABLED}
        />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

```ruby
# Backend: app/graphql/types/course_settings_type.rb
field :game_enabled, Boolean, "Whether the course has game features enabled", null: true
def game_enabled
  course.settings[:game_enabled] || false
end
```

### Advantages of Course Settings

#### 1. **Seamless Integration**
- Direct access to Canvas permissions system
- Automatic user authentication and context
- Native Canvas UI/UX consistency
- No external deployment needed

#### 2. **Simple Data Storage**
```ruby
# Store game settings in course.settings
course.settings[:game_enabled] = true
course.settings[:game_world_data] = {
  levels_unlocked: 3,
  player_progress: {...},
  achievements: [...]
}
course.save!
```

#### 3. **Straightforward Development**
- No LTI signature validation
- No external server deployment
- Uses existing Canvas build system
- Native Canvas API access

#### 4. **Better Performance**
- No iframe overhead
- Direct DOM access
- Native Canvas caching
- No cross-origin restrictions

## LTI Tool Approach (Original Plan)

### Disadvantages Revealed
- **Complexity**: Requires LTI 1.3 signature validation, key management
- **Deployment**: Separate infrastructure and deployment pipeline
- **Isolation**: Runs in iframe with limited Canvas integration
- **Authentication**: Complex user context passing
- **Development**: Separate codebase maintenance

### Only Benefit: Portability
- Could theoretically work with other LMS platforms
- But this isn't a requirement for Canvas-specific features

## Recommended Architecture: Internal Course Setting

### Game Integration Pattern
```
Course Settings Page
├── "Game World" Tab/Section
├── Game Settings Component (React)
│   ├── Enable/Disable Toggle
│   ├── Game Configuration Options
│   └── Game Canvas Component (Phaser.js)
└── Game Data Storage (course.settings)
```

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// ui/features/course_settings/react/components/CourseGameWorld.tsx
export default function CourseGameWorld({canManage, gameSettings}) {
  return (
    <div>
      {canManage && <GameSettingsPanel />}
      {gameSettings.enabled && <GameCanvas />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Database Schema
```ruby
# No new tables needed! Use course.settings
{
  game_enabled: true,
  game_world_config: {
    theme: 'forest',
    difficulty: 'normal'
  },
  game_student_progress: {
    user_id_123: {
      current_level: 5,
      achievements: ['first_quest', 'level_master'],
      last_played: '2025-01-15'
    }
  }
}
```

## Migration Strategy from Research

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
1. Add game settings to course settings page
2. Simple toggle to enable/disable game features
3. Basic Phaser.js canvas integration

### Phase 2: Core Game Features
1. Game world rendering and basic mechanics
2. Progress tracking in course.settings
3. Student/teacher view permissions

### Phase 3: Canvas Integration
1. Grade integration with assignments
2. Analytics and progress reporting
3. Group/collaboration features

## Conclusion

**Course Settings is dramatically simpler and better integrated than LTI.**

The course settings approach provides:
- ✅ Native Canvas integration
- ✅ Simplified authentication 
- ✅ Direct data access
- ✅ No external deployment
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Easier development

The LTI approach only made sense if we needed to support multiple LMS platforms, but since this is Canvas-specific, internal integration is clearly superior.
