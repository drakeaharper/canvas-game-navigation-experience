# Canvas Integration Technical Details

## LTI 1.3 Integration Architecture

### Developer Key Setup
1. **Admin Configuration**: Configure LTI key from Canvas Developer Keys page
2. **JSON Configuration**: Supply JSON block or URL hosting configuration
3. **HTTPS Requirement**: All LTI 1.3 plugins must be served over HTTPS
4. **Tool Deployment**: Deploy to accounts, sub-accounts, or specific courses

### LTI Placements Available
- **Course Navigation**: Left-hand navigation bar
- **Assignment Selection**: Custom assignment types
- **Rich Content Editor**: Embedded content
- **Module Items**: Direct module integration
- **Account Navigation**: Admin-level tools

## Canvas API Integration Points

### Authentication
- LTI launch provides user context and authentication
- Canvas API tokens for server-to-server communication
- OAuth 2.0 flow for user-initiated API calls

### Data Access Patterns
```javascript
// Example API endpoints relevant for game integration
GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/users           // Course roster
GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments     // Assignments
POST /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments    // Create assignments
PUT /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/:id/submissions/:user_id/grade // Submit grades
GET /api/v1/users/:user_id/profile             // User profile data
POST /api/v1/courses/:course_id/discussion_topics // Create discussions
```

### Grade Synchronization
- **LTI 1.1 Outcomes Service**: Legacy grade passback
- **LTI 1.3 Assignment and Grade Services**: Modern grade sync
- **Canvas API**: Direct grade manipulation
- **Real-time Updates**: Webhooks for grade changes

## Game-Specific Integration Opportunities

### Progress Tracking
- Store game progress in Canvas custom user data
- Use Canvas analytics for learning outcomes
- Track time spent, levels completed, achievements earned

### Social Learning Features
- Canvas Groups API for team-based gameplay
- Discussion boards for game-related conversations  
- Peer review assignments for game creations

### Gamification Elements
- Canvas badges/achievements system
- Point-based grading aligned with game mechanics
- Leaderboards using Canvas gradebook data

## Implementation within Canvas LMS Codebase

### Existing Infrastructure to Leverage
- **GraphQL API**: `app/graphql/` for data queries
- **React Components**: `ui/shared/` for UI consistency
- **Plugin System**: `gems/plugins/` for modular development
- **Testing Framework**: Jest/Vitest for frontend, RSpec for backend

### Development Approach Options

#### Option 1: Internal Canvas Feature
```
app/controllers/games_controller.rb          # Game API endpoints
app/models/game_*.rb                        # Game data models
ui/features/games/                          # React game components
ui/features/games/components/GameCanvas.jsx # Game rendering
```

#### Option 2: Canvas Plugin (gems/plugins/)
```
gems/plugins/canvas_games/
├── lib/canvas_games/
├── app/controllers/
├── app/models/
└── ui/features/games/
```

#### Option 3: External LTI Application
- Separate deployment and codebase
- Communicates via LTI and Canvas API
- More isolated but requires separate infrastructure

### Database Considerations
- **Sharding**: Canvas uses Switchman for database sharding
- **Multi-tenancy**: Account-based data isolation
- **Performance**: Consider read replicas for game data queries

## Security Considerations

### LTI Security
- Proper signature validation for LTI launches
- Secure token storage and rotation
- User context validation

### Canvas API Security  
- API token scoping and permissions
- Rate limiting compliance
- Proper error handling to avoid data leaks

### Game Security
- Client-side game state validation
- Server-side score verification
- Prevention of game manipulation/cheating

## Performance Optimization

### Canvas LMS Integration
- Cache Canvas API responses appropriately
- Use GraphQL for efficient data fetching
- Implement proper pagination for large datasets

### Game Performance
- Asset optimization and lazy loading
- Canvas element optimization
- Memory management for long game sessions

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Use existing Canvas docker-compose setup
- Hot reload for game development
- Integration with Canvas webpack/rspack build

### Production Considerations
- CDN for game assets
- Separate scaling for game servers if needed
- Health checks and monitoring
- Canvas plugin deployment process

## Next Steps for Technical Implementation

1. **Prototype LTI Integration**: Build minimal LTI 1.3 app
2. **Canvas API Exploration**: Test relevant API endpoints
3. **Game Engine Setup**: Integrate Phaser.js with React
4. **Data Model Design**: Define game-specific database schema
5. **Security Implementation**: LTI signature validation
6. **Performance Testing**: Load testing with Canvas API
