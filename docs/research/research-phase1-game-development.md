# Canvas Course World - Research Phase 1: Game Development Approaches

## Overview
Research into the best approaches for building a 2D browser-based game that integrates with Canvas LMS as a backend for data storage and retrieval.

## Top JavaScript 2D Game Development Frameworks (2025)

### 1. Phaser.js ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Why it's ideal**: Industry-leading 2D game framework with comprehensive features
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses Pixi.js under the hood for optimized rendering
  - WebGL acceleration with Canvas fallback
  - Built-in physics, animations, input handling, sound, asset management
  - TypeScript support
  - Extensive plugin ecosystem
- **Best for**: Complete game development with all features in one package
- **Learning curve**: Beginner-friendly with extensive documentation

### 2. Pixi.js
- **Why consider**: Maximum performance and rendering control
- **Key Features**:
  - Extremely fast hardware-accelerated 2D renderer
  - WebGL with Canvas fallback
  - Fine-grained control over graphics pipeline
  - Optimized for high frame rate games
- **Best for**: Performance-critical games or custom game engines
- **Learning curve**: More complex, requires additional libraries for game logic

### 3. MelonJS
- **Key Features**:
  - ES6 class-based architecture
  - WebGL renderer with Canvas fallback
  - Built for sprite-based 2D graphics
- **Best for**: Modern JavaScript developers wanting clean architecture

### 4. ExcaliburJS
- **Key Features**:
  - TypeScript-first approach
  - Modern game development patterns
- **Best for**: TypeScript-heavy development environments

## Integration with Canvas LMS

### LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) Integration
- **Standard**: Canvas supports LTI 1.3 (LTI Advantage)
- **Architecture**: Independent web application that communicates with Canvas
- **Requirements**: 
  - HTTPS deployment
  - LTI Developer Key configuration
  - JSON configuration block or hosted configuration URL

### Integration Approaches

#### Option 1: LTI External Tool (Recommended)
- Build game as independent web application
- Deploy as LTI 1.3 plugin
- Communicate with Canvas API for:
  - User authentication
  - Grade synchronization
  - Course data access
  - Progress tracking

#### Option 2: Canvas Plugin System
- Less practical for game development
- Limited documentation and support
- Not recommended for complex applications

## React Integration Strategies

### Approach 1: React UI Overlay ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Use HTML5 Canvas for game rendering
- React for UI components (menus, HUD, modals)
- Separate concerns: game logic vs. UI management
- **Benefits**:
  - Leverages React's strengths (responsive UI, accessibility)
  - Maintains game performance
  - Easy to integrate with existing Canvas LMS React components

### Approach 2: Direct React Canvas Integration
- React components wrapping canvas elements
- Use refs and useEffect for canvas manipulation
- Consider react-konva for complex graphics
- **Benefits**: 
  - Full React ecosystem integration
  - Component-based architecture
- **Challenges**:
  - Performance considerations
  - Anti-pattern for reactive state management in games

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Modern browsers support hardware acceleration
- WebGL for optimal 2D rendering performance
- Canvas fallback for older browsers

### State Management
- Games require non-reactive state updates (opposite of React patterns)
- Consider using closures, class instances, or module scope for game state
- React state for UI components only

### Development Environment
- Integrate with existing Canvas LMS build system (Rspack/Webpack)
- TypeScript support for type safety
- Follow Canvas LMS coding conventions

## Recommendation

**Primary Recommendation**: Phaser.js with React UI overlay
- Phaser.js handles game logic, rendering, and physics
- React components for UI elements (menus, dialogs, progress displays)
- LTI 1.3 integration for Canvas LMS communication
- Deploy as independent web application

**Architecture**:
```
Canvas LMS (host) 
  ↓ LTI launch
Independent Game App
  ├── Phaser.js (game engine)
  ├── React (UI components) 
  ├── Canvas API client (data sync)
  └── Grade passback via LTI
```

This approach provides the best balance of:
- Game development productivity (Phaser.js)
- UI flexibility (React)
- Canvas LMS integration (LTI + API)
- Performance optimization
- Maintainability within existing codebase
