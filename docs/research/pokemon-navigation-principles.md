# Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire Navigation Principles

## Core Perspective

### Top-Down View
- Camera positioned directly above the player character
- Bird's-eye/overhead perspective maintained throughout gameplay
- Fixed camera angle with no rotation or tilting

### 2D Sprite-Based Graphics
- Characters and environment represented as 2D sprites
- Tile-based world construction
- Visual clarity through simplified representation

## Movement Mechanics

### Grid-Based Movement
- Character moves on an invisible grid/tile system
- Four-directional movement (up, down, left, right)
- Discrete tile-to-tile transitions rather than free analog movement

### Player Control
- Direct character control in the overworld
- Walking as the default movement speed
- Optional speed boost via bicycle item
- Context-specific movement modes (surfing on water, flying between towns)

## World Structure

### Zone-Based Design
- World divided into discrete areas (routes, towns, caves, buildings)
- Connected regions that form a semi-open world
- Progressive unlocking through story progression and ability acquisition

### Interconnected Map
- Routes connect towns and points of interest
- Natural barriers create gated progression
- Shortcuts and alternate paths unlock as you gain new abilities

## Encounter System

### Separated Battle Screens
- Exploration and combat occur in different views
- Transition from overworld to battle screen when encounters trigger
- Return to exact overworld position after battle

### Random Encounters
- Walking through tall grass triggers random wild Pokémon battles
- Cave and water areas also feature random encounters
- Encounter rate varies by location type

### Visible Obstacles
- Trainers visible on the overworld
- Direct line-of-sight triggers trainer battles
- Non-random, scripted encounter system for human opponents

## Progression Gates

### Ability-Based Unlocking
- HM moves unlock new navigation options (Cut, Surf, Fly, etc.)
- Environmental puzzles require specific abilities
- Backtracking encouraged to access previously unreachable areas

### Story-Driven Barriers
- Certain paths blocked until story events complete
- NPCs or obstacles physically prevent early access
- Linear story progression through non-linear world design

## Navigation Aids

### Map System
- In-game map accessible through menu
- Shows current location and discovered areas
- Limited detail encourages exploration

### Environmental Signage
- Town signs and route markers
- NPC dialogue provides directions
- Visual landmarks help with orientation

## Design Philosophy

### Clarity Over Realism
- Simplified visual representation prioritizes gameplay understanding
- Clear distinction between walkable and blocked areas
- Color coding and visual cues guide player movement

### Exploration Rewarded
- Hidden items encourage thorough exploration
- Optional areas contain rare Pokémon and items
- Backtracking with new abilities reveals secrets

### Accessibility
- Simple, intuitive controls
- Clear visual feedback for actions
- Gradual introduction of navigation mechanics
